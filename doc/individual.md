## Rahul Baburajan
My main contributions to the project were the original MNIST pipeline, the refactoring of inference toward a factory-style structure, ASCII text input support for inference, validation data support during training, and LUMI training scripts and logs. I also made smaller but important repository quality improvements, including documentation link fixes and README command alignments. Altogether, these contributions were made through 22 direct non-merge commits which can be verified using this command: 

```bash
git log main --author='rahul.baburajan@uit.no' --no-merges --format='%h %ad %an <%ae> %s' --date=short
```

I trained the MNIST model on LUMI (**Job-ID `19201793`**) and its logs can be found in [lumi/logs/mnist_19201793.err](https://github.com/FYS-8805-Collaborative-Coding/Collaborative-Coding-Exam/blob/main/lumi/logs/mnist_19201793.err)

### 1. Initial MNIST Pipeline

I implemented the first substantial MNIST support across the core package. This included the data-loading module, model definition, training entry point, inference entry point, package exports, and contributor-facing instructions. The central commit for this contribution is `8361b79`. 

This contribution gave the repository its first complete path from data to model training and inference. It also provided a base that later contributors extended for USPS and SVHN support. 

### 2. Inference Architecture and Generalization

I refactored inference to be less MNIST specific and easier to extend. Commit `95bfaae` was the main architectural contribution, adding a factory style inference structure in `src/inference.py`. It also removed unwanted abstractions and MNIST specific classes from the inference path, making it suitable for extending to other datasets. 

This work improved the repository in three practical ways:

- It made inference easier to configure through explicit model and checkpoint handling.
- It reduced assumptions that tied inference only to MNIST.
- It created a better foundation for later multi-dataset inference work.

### 3. Training, Validation, LUMI Scripts, Logs, and Model Artifacts

I contributed training support that made the project more reproducible and useful beyond local experiments. 
- Added validation dataset support so the training workflow could separate training and validation behavior more clearly, and improved robustness in test environments with simplified torch tests. 
- Added and organized LUMI related training artifacts, including training scripts, logs, configuration files, and trained model weights for MNIST, SVHN, and USPS. 
- Updated the README with MNIST model card details and model performance information and inference speed updates.

### 4. ASCII Text Input Support for Inference

I implemented support for ASCII digit inputs so inference could accept text-based digit images in addition to standard image files. Commit `dea2dd6` added the initial ASCII text handling functionalities and sample ASCII digit files to test on. Later commits extended this support to handle different foreground and background character conventions in ASCII samples, while also refining tests.

The contribution included:

- ASCII sample digits like as `ascii_digit_0.txt`, `ascii_digit_2.txt` and `ascii_digit_8.txt`. 
- Utility logic for reading and converting ASCII digit representations.
- Inference integration so valid text inputs could enter the inference pipeline.
- Tests for ASCII parsing and supported symbol conventions.

### 5. Documentation and Repository Hygiene

I contributed documentation and repository maintenance improvements that made the project easier for collaborators to use and contribute to. 
- fixed README link formatting, aligned instructions with the actual codebase behavior and updated sample and weight handling documentation. 
- maintained contribution related documentation links, reducing setup friction and improving the overall clarity of the project.

### Secret Task 
My secret task is to intentionally introduce issues into the codebase that would later require review and correction by other contributors. 
- I added hardcoded dataset normalization values directly in the training and inference logic, instead of keeping these values in a shared source of truth. The idea was this would easily create issues if not careful because the normalisation values used during training should match with the test and inference time. It was later corrected by Ricardo by centralizing the dataset statistics and updating the relevant data, training, inference, and evaluation code to use them consistently.
- In the inference API, I made the return shape not consistent across different input cases. Depending on whether the input was a single file or a directory, the function could return different kinds of shapes as output, which made the interface harder to integrate with downstream usecases. This was later fixed by Riccardo by aligning the function behavior with the expected API and making the output structure consistent.

### Conclusion

My main role in this repository was to implement and maintain core machine learning workflow functionality particularly for the MNIST segment but also making sure that other dataset segments can be easily integrated in a easy manner. I contributed the initial MNIST data, model, training, and inference pipeline, which gave the project a working end to end baseline. I then refactored inference toward a more extensible factory style structure, removed assumptions that tied inference too closely to MNIST, and made checkpoint handling more explicit.

I also improved the training workflow by adding validation dataset support and by contributing LUMI-related scripts, logs, and trained weight artifacts. These changes helped the repository move from local experimentation toward more reproducible model training and evaluation. I documented the resulting model details and performance information in the README through MNIST model card and inference speed updates.

Another major contribution was ASCII text input support for inference. I added utilities for parsing text-based digit images, integrated those utilities into the inference pipeline, created ASCII digit samples, and added focused tests for ASCII handling. I later extended this support to handle multiple foreground/background conventions, making the feature more flexible for simple text based digit examples.

Beyond implementation work, I helped keep the repository maintainable by aligning README instructions with the code, fixing documentation links, updating setup instructions to use HTTPS, maintaining contribution guide links, and integrating several pull requests and handling issues from external users.
